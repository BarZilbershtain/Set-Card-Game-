# Set-Card-Game-
Implemention of the game “Set”.
The main focus was on designing and coordinating concurrent components, including the dealer and multiple players, in a synchronized and thread-safe manner. Each player interacts with the shared game table, attempting to identify valid sets of cards, while the dealer manages the game flow, validates sets, updates scores, and handles timeouts and penalties. The graphical interface, input handling, and configuration system were provided, and the implementation focused on the core game logic, efficient synchronization, and ensuring smooth and correct game behavior under concurrent execution.
